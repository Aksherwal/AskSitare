# AskSitare

AskSitare is an intelligent chatbot web application designed specifically for Sitare University. It uses natural language processing and semantic search to provide accurate responses to university-related queries.

## Features

- Real-time chat interface for student queries
- Semantic search using sentence transformers
- Integration with Groq's LLaMA 3.3 70B model for generating responses
- Feedback system for response quality tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring feedback
- PostgreSQL database for storing questions and feedback
- Vector similarity search for finding relevant responses

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with psycopg2
- **AI/ML**:
  - Groq API for LLM integration
  - Sentence Transformers for text embeddings
  - LLaMA 3.3 70B model for response generation
